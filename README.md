# ShoppingList
This is a simple shopping list application where an user can make list of items they would like to buy. I created this application as a class project, when I took Mobile Software Development course that was taught by Dr. PÃ‰TER EKLER. This application consists of multiple activities, RecyclerView, Animation loading screen, and Persistence data storage (Room). Items can have the following attributes: name, description, price, status (if it has been bough yet), and category. All the items along with their attributes will be saved in the persistence data storage. Also, an user can edit and remove any item from the existing list of items.
